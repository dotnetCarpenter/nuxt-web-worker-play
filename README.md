# web-worker

> Nuxt.js project

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install # Or yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
# nuxt 1.4 and below does not support web workers in dev mode
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
# in nuxt 1.4 and below you have to create a production build to use web workers in non 'spa' mode
$ npm run build
$ npm start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [Nuxt.js docs](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js).
